# scPASI: Single-cell Phenotype-associated Subpopulation Identification via Transfer Foundation Model and Statistical Ensemble Learning

## Introduction

scPASI is a robust framework that extracts features from transcriptomic data and performs statistical analysis on regression coefficients to identify and stratify cell subpopulations into Strongly Positive (SP), Weakly Positive (WP), Strongly Negative (SN), and Weakly Negative (WN) groups.

scPASI includes four sub-modules: PFM-based feature extraction module, Res-VAE transfer learning module, statistical feature learning module, and cell phenotype identification module.
